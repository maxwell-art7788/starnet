/* STARNET — build.js : the diegetic full-screen BUILD MODE (build) mode.

   Toggled from the dock. Dims the live sim and drops the Commander into an in-fiction

   a ghost preview that snaps to tiles and tints green/red via the model's validators,
   and an in-fiction toolbar — PLACE ROOM · HALLWAY · SURFACE · MOVE · DELETE · UNDO.

   It reads + mutates the canonical WorldModel station (the single source of truth) and

  /* ---------- THE CANDIDATE FIELD: "where can this line go?" ----------

     the model accepts, washed dim over the deck, and the ghost SNAPS to the nearest one so
     "click roughly there" lands.

     COST + DETERMINISM. One scan is (bounds + FIELD_MARGIN)² checkBlueprint calls — far too much
     for a frame. It runs lazily on first ask per blueprint and is cached until station.onChange
     drops it (clearLineFields). No RNG, no time input: the same floor always yields the same field.
     The scan is also bounded to the DECK's neighbourhood — every blueprint tile must sit on a room,
     so a legal anchor can never be more than half a footprint outside the station bounds. */

  /* ---------- THE CARD STACK (2026-08-07 conveyor audit) ----------
     Every modal card in BUILD MODE — the first-run guide, the step editor, the workstation picker, the flow /
     belt / junction / connector / room / door cards — mounts as `.refit-guide` + its own marker class, and
     each one owns a `closeP` that does the work closing it OWES: the step card saves the job brief, the
     flow card saves the line name, the room card saves the rename. Nothing outside those closures could
     reach them, so two callers took a shortcut and paid for it:
       • ESC matched `.refit-guide` — the class they ALL share — then markSeen()'d and removeChild()'d
         directly. Pressing ESC over a step card threw away an unsaved job brief AND permanently marked
         the build-mode guide seen, for a card that was not the guide. The law was even written down two
         hundred lines below ("gate on `.refit-firstrun`, NEVER `.refit-guide`") and broken here.
       • Every opener bailed out (`if (already mounted) return`) instead of replacing, so FINISH ① CREW
         and the live world's NO AGENT nag did NOTHING while any other dock's card was open.
     So: a card REGISTERS its own close path on its element, and both callers route through it. Closing is
     always the card's own closing; opening always replaces whatever is up. */

     reaching a BOUND bay (valPlan.reach), which is the moment liveTiles first energize a full
     route — the narrated ▸ PREVIEW ride auto-runs once, unprompted. That is exactly the teachable
     moment: the user just bound the agent that powered the line on. Once per station, persisted
     in localStorage keyed by the station doc's createdAt (doc.meta is whitelisted-fields
     territory in migrate() — a save-schema field for a UI one-shot is the wrong tool; localStorage
     mirrors the SEEN_KEY idiom above and survives reloads the same way).
     LAW (tutorial-audit 2026-08-03): anything coach-like stands down while the tutorial is
     coaching — gate on Tutorial.isCoaching() and the `.refit-firstrun` card, NEVER `.refit-guide`
     (the bay/flow/junction editors share that class; suppressing on it would kill the ride the
     moment the bay picker that caused it closed). Gated attempts stay ARMED (ridePending) and
     fire from the frame loop once the coach clears — a deferred ride must not need another edit
     to re-trigger. A blueprint stamp alone can never fire this: its bays stamp unbound, so reach
     stays false until an agent is truly bound. */

     server-proven feed truth (World.feedState — the exact NO FEED source), and the sample-job seam
     (feature-detected, below). LAWS: never blocks editing (a floating side card, no backdrop),
     dismissible, stands down while the tutorial coaches (Tutorial.isCoaching / .refit-firstrun —
     same gate as the first ride), and retires PERMANENTLY per line when that line's first real
     product crate delivers (world.js's delivery seam calls noteLineDelivered — event-driven).

     inside the prop palette was too easy to miss, so the powers checklist takes this card
     instead (same one-voice slot; FINISH THE LINE still takes over the moment a line compiles).

     The list is PropSprites.STARTER (the tutorial kit + studio — capability grants only, no bay:
     that is conveyor equipment, not a necessity). Every row is a live projection of the model:
     done = the POWER is on the floor, by GRANT not by id (a placed VAULT honestly ticks the
     INTEL CAB row — both grant FILES), and clicking a row ARMS the prop tool with that prop
     picked — the checklist is the control, not a description of one. It gates nothing. The card
     retires on its own at 5/5 WITHOUT burning the dismiss key, so reclaiming your only dish
     brings it back; ✕ still dismisses it forever for Commanders who know the drill. */

     ROOM and HALLWAY were drag-ONLY, and a plain click was worse than nothing: it committed a 1×1
     footprint, which the model correctly rejects ("room min 3×3", "hallway too short"). So the most
     natural thing to try with a tool armed — point at the floor and click — was guaranteed to fail
     and to teach a size rule by refusing you. Now a click stamps the LAST SIZE YOU DREW (seeded at
     a sensible default), the same size the hover ghost has been previewing under the cursor the
     whole time, so what a click does is visible BEFORE you commit to it. Dragging still does
     exactly what it always did, and every drag re-teaches the click its size.
     The cursor tile is the footprint's TOP-LEFT — identical to where a drag starts from — so the
     ghost never jumps when you switch from clicking to dragging. */

  /* ---------- SNAP FLUSH (2026-08-10) ----------
     Andrew's own station, read out of his save: EIGHT rooms, and not one pair of them touching —
     r5/r6/r7/r8 sit ONE tile off r1, r3 two, r9 three. The seam classifier finds 0 open joins, so
     what reads as "the floors won't blend" is not a blend failure at all: it is eight separate
     hulls, each correctly drawing its own wall and shell across a gap of void. Close the gaps and
     the same seven rooms give 72 open joins and one continuous deck.

     Nothing was stopping him. `checkRects` rejects OVERLAP and nothing else, so a one-tile gap is a
     perfectly legal placement — and at TILE=12 it is a handful of screen pixels, invisible until the
     bake draws two walls where you expected none. The tool let you miss by one and said nothing.

     So the fix is in the GESTURE, not the bake: within SNAP_FIT tiles of an existing footprint, a
     placement lands FLUSH against it. Two behaviours, because the two gestures mean different things:
       · a CLICK stamps a remembered size -> TRANSLATE the rect, never resize it. The size is what
         the user last drew and is not ours to change.
       · a DRAG is sizing -> move the EDGE that is near a neighbour, so the room you are drawing
         grows to meet the one already there.
     A snap is only ever offered when the two footprints actually FACE each other (their spans
     overlap on the other axis) — otherwise a room across the station would tug at a placement it can
     never touch. And every candidate is re-validated through the model's own validator before it is
     accepted, so a snap can never create the overlap the snap exists to avoid.

     The ghost and the commit both call this, which is the same contract the LINES tool already
     holds: what a click commits is exactly what was on screen. */

  /* ---------- ONE BAD LAYER MUST NOT BLANK THE CANVAS ----------
     The frame used to be a single try/catch: any draw dependency that threw skipped EVERY layer

     A real case: a refused sidecar (the page's token dies when the sidecar restarts under it) left
     prop data undefined and PropSprites threw out of drawProps — the light layer, the ghost and
     every label after it never ran, on a loop.

     Each layer now paints inside its own guard. A failure costs THAT layer and nothing else; the
     rest of the frame paints. It is reported (one console.warn per layer per session — not
     silenced, and never papered over with fake state) and stamped on the overlay's dataset so a
     harness can read the degradation instead of guessing at a dark screenshot.

     STATE HYGIENE: a layer that throws mid-draw leaves the 2D context wherever it died — an
     unbalanced save(), a stray globalAlpha, a clip. The guard brackets the layer with its own
     save() and unwinds to exactly that depth afterwards, detected with a sentinel miterLimit
     (the 2D API exposes no stack depth). Without the unwind, one throwing layer per frame would

       DECK   — the real footprint. Per-tile cells, brightest: this is floor that exists.
       APRON  — GRID_APRON tiles of open space around the station bounds. Full minor grid: the
                ground you actually build on next, so a drag has something to snap against.
       VOID   — beyond that, MAJOR divisions only, faint. Open space, with a coarse ruler.

     Majors land every GRID_MAJOR tiles (a "bay") so 8 tiles is countable at a glance, and minor
     lines fade out entirely once a tile is only a few device px (below that they alias into a grey
